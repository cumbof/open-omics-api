# Open-Omics APIs

We propose design principles for organizing biomedical data and make them easily accessible through the development of a collection of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), in order to provide a flexible framework that we called OpenOmics. To prove the validity of our approach, we apply it on data extracted from The Genomic Data Commons repository. OpenOmics is free and open source for allowing everyone to extend the set of provided APIs with new features that may be able to answer specific biological questions.

OpenOmics is available at [http://bioinformatics.iasi.cnr.it/openomics/api/routes](http://bioinformatics.iasi.cnr.it/openomics/api/routes)
